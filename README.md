# Country App

This is an app for finding out information relating to a country, built using React.JS and a web API. It also has a dark-mode colour option.

## Tech used

This app uses React.JS and HTML/CSS. it also uses Styled-Components to manage CSS/styling.

This app uses data from an API to display the details for each country:

## Lessons Learned

During this project I learned the importance of handling API cases where no result is found. This can cause errors in components if they are not managed correctly.
